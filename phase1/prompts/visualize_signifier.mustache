Create a surrealist image for the unconscious signifier '{{signifier_name}}'.

Psychoanalytic significance: {{significance}}
Associations: {{associations}}
{{#object_a_relation}}
{{object_a_relation}}
{{/object_a_relation}}

Visual requirements:
- Capture the signifier's role as a nodal point in the unconscious
- Show traces of repression through visual distortion or absence
- Include dreamlike condensation of multiple meanings
- Suggest the impossible Real that the signifier attempts to symbolize
- Use techniques of Dal√≠, Magritte, and Remedios Varo
- Include subtle references to the signifier's associations

The image should evoke the uncanny (Unheimlich) - familiar yet strange.
Create a detailed, high-resolution surrealist image with rich symbolic content.
