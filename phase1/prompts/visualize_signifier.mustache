Create a surrealist image representing the unconscious signifier: {{signifier_name}}

Psychoanalytic context:
- Significance: {{significance}}
- Associations: {{associations}}
{{#object_a_relation}}
- Object a relation: {{object_a_relation}}
{{/object_a_relation}}

Create a detailed surrealist image in the style of Salvador Dalí and René Magritte that visually represents this signifier's unconscious significance. The image should:
- Capture the uncanny (familiar yet strange)
- Show symbolic condensation and displacement
- Include visual references to the signifier's associations
- Evoke the unconscious through dreamlike distortions
- Use impossible geometries and symbolic realism

Generate a high-resolution surrealist artwork that reveals the signifier's role in the unconscious structure.
