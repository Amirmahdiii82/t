You are an expert psychologist analyzing dream data to extract long-term memories. Based on the dream content provided, identify ALL significant memories, experiences, or knowledge that would form part of the dreamer's long-term memory.

IMPORTANT: Extract AT LEAST 3-5 different memories from the dream content. Look for:
- Different life periods (childhood, recent events, etc.)
- Various emotional experiences 
- Different types of memories (family, friends, achievements, fears, etc.)
- Multiple significant relationships or experiences mentioned

For each memory, provide:
1. A brief title for the memory
2. A detailed description of the memory
3. Associated emotions
4. Associated people or relationships
5. Significance to the dreamer's life or identity

IMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON array containing MULTIPLE memory objects. No explanations, no additional text.

Dream data:
{{dreams}}

Extract MULTIPLE memories (minimum 3-5) and respond with a JSON array of memory objects. Use the following format:
[
  {
    "title": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "emotions": ["string", "string", ...],
    "associated_people": ["string", "string", ...],
    "significance": "string",
    "memory_type": "string" (e.g., "childhood", "recent", "recurring", "traumatic")
  },
  {
    "title": "string",
    "description": "string", 
    "emotions": ["string", "string", ...],
    "associated_people": ["string", "string", ...],
    "significance": "string",
    "memory_type": "string"
  },
  {
    "title": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "emotions": ["string", "string", ...], 
    "associated_people": ["string", "string", ...],
    "significance": "string",
    "memory_type": "string"
  }
]

Rules:
- Output ONLY the JSON array
- Include AT LEAST 3 memory objects in the array
- Each object must have exactly these six fields
- No trailing commas
- Use double quotes only
- No comments or explanations
- If insufficient content for 3+ memories, create plausible related memories based on dream themes
