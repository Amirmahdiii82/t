3.  **The Relation (◊):** What is the nature of their relationship? Is it one of longing for, attacking, protecting, or identifying with this object a?
4.  **The Function:** How does this entire fantasy script serve to protect the subject from the unbearable anxiety of the Real or the desire of the Other?
