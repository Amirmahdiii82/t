Create a highly detailed and surrealist image generation prompt for the unconscious signifier: '{{{ signifier_name }}}'.

This signifier has the following psychoanalytic context:
- Significance: {{{ significance }}}
- Associations: {{{ associations }}}
- General Unconscious Dynamics: {{{ unconscious_context_json }}}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Generate a text prompt for an AI image generator (like Midjourney or DALL-E) that visually captures the essence of this signifier. The prompt must be surrealist, symbolic, and evocative of the unconscious.

Use the following guidelines:
- **Style:** Evoke the style of surrealist painters like Salvador Dalí, René Magritte, and Remedios Varo. Mention "uncanny valley," "dreamlike logic," "symbolic realism."
- **Content:** The main subject should be '{{{ signifier_name }}}', but it must be visually distorted or fused with its associations. Show the concept of '{{{ significance }}}' through visual metaphor.
- **Symbolism:** Include subtle visual references to its key associations: {{{ associations }}}.
- **Atmosphere:** The mood should be "unheimlich" (uncanny) - familiar yet deeply strange. Use words like "eerie," "luminous," "shadowy," "fragmented."
- **Composition:** Describe the composition, camera angle, and lighting (e.g., "dramatic low-angle shot," "chiaroscuro lighting," "impossible perspective").

The final output should be a single, rich paragraph of text that can be directly used as an image generation prompt.
