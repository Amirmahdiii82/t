Analyze the economy of jouissance (painful, excessive enjoyment) based on the subject's dreams and primary symptom.

DREAM EXCERPT:
{{{ dreams_json }}}

PRIMARY SYMPTOM:
{{{ symptom_json }}}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Map how the subject organizes their jouissance, which operates beyond the pleasure principle. Your analysis should be returned as a single JSON object with the following keys:

- "surplus_jouissance": (plus-de-jouir) Where does the subject seem to derive an excess, almost painful enjoyment? Identify the specific scenarios or signifiers.
- "repetition_compulsion": What patterns or actions are repeated compulsively in the dreams, even if they lead to anxiety or failure? This repetition is a key marker of jouissance.
- "points_of_anxiety": Identify the moments or symbols in the dreams that signal the intrusion of the Real, causing anxiety. Anxiety is the only affect that is not deceptive.
- "sinthome_hypothesis": Propose a potential "sinthome" for the subject. The sinthome is the unique, singular way the subject manages to hold their psychic structure together through a particular mode of jouissance. It is a creative, albeit symptomatic, solution.

Return ONLY the complete JSON object.
