Analyze the primary process dream-work mechanisms based on the provided unconscious structure.

UNCONSCIOUS STRUCTURE:

Signifiers:
{{{ signifiers_json }}}

Signifying Chains:
{{{ chains_json }}}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Based on the structure above, identify and provide specific examples for the following Freudian/Lacanian dream-work mechanisms. Return a single JSON object.

- "condensation": (Verdichtung) Find examples where a single signifier in a dream clearly represents a nexus of multiple other ideas or chains.
- "displacement": (Verschiebung) Find examples where the emotional intensity (affect) seems to have been shifted from a significant object to a trivial one.
- "representability": (Rücksicht auf Darstellbarkeit) Find examples of how abstract thoughts or conflicts are converted into concrete, visual, or sensory images in the dreams.
- "secondary_revision": (Sekundäre Bearbeitung) Identify elements that seem to have been added to the dream to make it more logical or coherent, potentially masking the chaotic primary process underneath.

Return ONLY the complete JSON object with keys "condensation", "displacement", "representability", and "secondary_revision". Each key should hold a list of strings, with each string being a specific example and its explanation.
