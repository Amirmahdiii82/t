The recurring motifs of Zack's indecision, competition with Alice, and the unfinished tasks all point to a core conflict: her struggle to secure a stable and fulfilling relationship while battling feelings of insecurity and self-doubt. Her oscillation between the Hysteric's and Master's discourses reveals a defensive strategy, attempting to assert control and demand answers in the face of her perceived lack. The presence of maternal comfort underscores her continued reliance on her mother for emotional support, suggesting an unresolved Oedipal dynamic and a difficulty in fully separating and establishing her own sense of autonomy. Overall, the dreams paint a picture of a woman grappling with the challenges of love, motherhood, and the ongoing search for a secure and stable sense of self.",

While these outbursts often lead to negative consequences (guilt, shame, further instability in the relationship), they provide a paradoxical form of enjoyment by allowing her to momentarily overcome her feelings of vulnerability and assert her dominance. This 'benefit' reinforces the cycle of aggression as a preferred mode of coping with anxiety and frustration."
