TITLE: The Lost Baby
------------------------------

ACTIVATED SIGNIFIERS:
- Zack

DREAM NARRATIVE:

As I wandered through the corridor, the baby carriages started to multiply and change, like they were shifting and morphing before my eyes. I saw Zack's face in each of the babies, but it was distorted and unrecognizable. I felt like I was losing my grip on reality, and the corridor seemed to be stretching out before me like a endless, surreal landscape. Suddenly, I heard the sound of a baby crying, and I knew that I had to find the source of the sound. I followed the cry to a large, empty room, where I found a single baby carriage with a small, fragile baby inside. But as I reached out to touch the baby, it vanished into thin air, leaving me with a sense of loss and longing.

Scene 2: A dark, labyrinthine corridor
I'm searching for the right baby, but they all look the same. I feel panicked and disoriented.

Scene 3: An empty room
I've found the baby, but it vanishes into thin air. I feel a sense of loss and longing.
