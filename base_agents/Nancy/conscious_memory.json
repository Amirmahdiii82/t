But when I know about what it means to me, it's about being strong and resilient, like when I stood up for myself against Alice. It's about being there for my daughters and giving them the best life possible. \n\nAnd it's also about navigating my relationship with Zack, which isn't always easy. There are trust issues and communication problems, but I care about him deeply and I want to make it work. I guess what I'm trying to say is that, for me, \"what it means\" is about finding my own path and being true to myself, even when things get tough. It's about learning from my experiences, like my dad's behavior and Zack's infidelity, and using those lessons to grow and become a better person. Does that make sense?",

It was our special tradition, just the two of us. We'd put on some music, and she'd teach me all about measuring ingredients and mixing everything together. (laughs) I was always so fascinated by how she could make something so delicious from just a few simple ingredients.\n\nBut what really stands out about those Sundays was the way my mom would talk to me. She'd tell me all about her own childhood, about her parents and grandparents, and all the struggles they faced. She'd share stories about how she overcame obstacles and achieved her goals, and it always inspired me to be strong and determined, just like her.\n\nThose moments with my mom were really special, because... (pausing, getting a bit emotional) ...my dad was struggling with his drinking problems at the time, and it was hard for all of us. But my mom was always there, being a rock for our family, and those Sundays were just our time to escape all the chaos and be together.\n\nEven now, as a mom myself, I try to recreate those special moments with my own daughters. We have our own traditions, like having a picnic in the park or going on a hike together. And I hope that, just like my mom did for me, I can pass on the values of strength, resilience, and love to my girls. (smiling) Sorry, I'm getting a bit sentimental... (laughs)",

I was going through a tough time with school and the girls, and he just showed up with these gorgeous white lilies. It completely lifted my mood and made me feel loved and appreciated. You know, it's funny, every time I see lilies now, I think of him and that special moment we shared. It's like the flower represents the love and support we have for each other. Do you have a special connection to lilium flowers, or is there something specific that made you think of them?",
