Not just hear the words, but actually understand what's going on beneath the surface. \n\nI've been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately, like there's just so much going on in my head and I don't know how to process it all. It's like my thoughts are racing, and I'm just trying to keep up. But at the same time, I feel kind of... stuck. Like I'm not really moving forward, just spinning my wheels. Does that make sense? \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm glad you're here. I feel like I can talk to you about this stuff, and you won't judge me. You'll just... get it. And that's a really nice feeling. So, how are you? What's been going on in your life?",

And now she's just gone, like she never existed. It's weird to think about. (pauses again) But I guess this means we can finally start fresh, you know? Without all the baggage from the past.

(starts to ramble) I mean, I know he cares about Alice, but she's made her choice, right? And we have to think about our own family now...
