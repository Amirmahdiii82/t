            "content": "I am in an unfamiliar classroom and I seem to be taking care of or supervising a boy about the age of five. He has blond hair and seems very average in appearance. He is playing quietly by himself and I really have no contact with him at all. There are many toys strewn about the room and everything is multicolored and bright, like a kindergarten classroom might be but more vivid. The room is full of other people including other adults and children, it is a busy atmosphere with movement everywhere. Nevertheless, my attention is not where it might be expected. I am sitting on the floor by the boy and near me are two very good-looking, dark-skinned girls. They tell me that they are both 17 years old and that they also both have the same boyfriend. At the exact same time all three of us say, \"Lucky guy\" (meaning the boyfriend is lucky). I remember being more interested in the two girls than the boy I am supposed to watch. The dream seems to end with me talking to the two girls."

It feels like a place where tourists would go to buy overpriced T-shirts or something. As I walk down the street I notice a group of about six people walking up the other side of the street. There are four random, unfamiliar guys and two girls. One of the girls is an unimportant friend from high school who I last saw in line at some club a year ago, and I ignored her, sort of. Even though I recognize her and make eye contact, I walk by like I did not see her. For some reason I know that I do not want to talk to her. As I glance back, I notice that she has changed and is now someone else, but I do not know this person. I keep walking by and someone yells my name, and I turn around to see who is calling me. Now the girl is my girlfriend and she says something like, \"Are you going to say hello at least, or are you going to just walk by?\" I walk over to her and the other girl who is with her and I tell my girlfriend that I did not even see or notice her. The other girl (who I do not know) looks at her and says, \"C'mon, Patty, let's go.\" Then she laughs and says, \"Oh, my God, I just called you Patty, and that is my name!\" Then I woke up."

It seems like I might be at a really mellow party or barbecue because there are other people mingling about. All I remember is that there is a very pretty girl walking up to me that I do not know. She comes up to me in a very friendly manner and says, \"Hi, Tony.\" I just smile and I do not correct her on calling me the wrong name. She walks away and that is the end."

I walk out of my room and into the hallway toward the bathroom. As I near the bathroom and my parent's room, I can hear my dad talking in his sleep. I cannot see him because the door is closed, but somehow I know he is talking in his sleep. I cannot really make out what he is saying, but he is obviously angry and the tone of his voice is very pissed off. I listen to him for a while and then I decide it is all pointless gibberish and I walk back to my room to go to sleep."

I am amazed to see that I have somehow lost 10 lbs., even though I have been lifting weights for almost two months and just gained about five pounds. I was really let down that all my effort had gone to waste and that I actually weighed less than when I started working out."

I am mostly playing with the three kids (ages 5-9) but only one of them is easily recognizable to me. The two boys do not look like they should, although I know that it is really them. Most of the time I am playing with a little girl, age 9, who looks just like she should. Basically, this was a happy dream and nothing too exciting ever happened."

I did not have my own board with me, but there were dozens of other boards just lying around for someone to use. I pick up and check out at least ten different boards, but something is wrong with each one. Either the trucks are too tight or loose or the deck is too narrow or the wheels are too small. No matter what I cannot find a board to ride. I am very frustrated because this is a perfect ramp and I just know that if I had a good board to ride that it would be fun and I would skate really well. I look around a little while longer until I realize that I will not find a good board and that I will never get to ride this ramp. Basically this frustrates me which in turn pisses me off."

I feel like I am drunk or on drugs because I am walking around all weird and I feel like I am out of control. I walk up to a car and inside are three fat girls about my age. I am talking to them for some reason, but as we are talking, the girls notice that I am looking down their tops. They are not very happy about it and I walk away. Soon I notice two good-looking girls walking on the other side of the street. I realize they are about to walk right by a house where all my friends are sitting o the porch. I walk across the street and right as I am in front of both my friends and the girls I do a somersault like Willy Wonka (basically act like you are falling but actually turn it into a forward somersault, it is not easy to do and looks pretty cool). As I stand up, I look at my friends and the girls and no one seems to be very impressed with me. I just sort of shrug it off."

One of the pairs of glasses is mine and as I go to grab them, I accidentally knock all the glasses right into the toilet. I think that I reached in and pulled them out, but I am not sure. I know that I wasn't too upset about the whole thing. I was like, \"Oh well, just another stupid mistake.\""

I asked him who he was talking about and he said that my dog was dead. He said that it died of a heart attack a while ago and they had forgot to tell me or something. I remember being extremely sad and I burst into tears because I was so bummed out. I was crying uncontrollably and I felt as miserable and depressed as I have ever felt in any dream or waking moment of my life. The sadness I felt was literally immeasurable. I was devastated that it was dead because he was the best (and my most favorite) dog I have ever had. This is probably the worst dream I have had since I was a child (in terms of how much it affected me)."
