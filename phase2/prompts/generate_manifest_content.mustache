Create a dream narrative using these dream-work elements:

Condensations: {{condensation}}
Displacements: {{displacement}}
Visual representations: {{representability}}
Symbols: {{symbolization}}

Create a surreal but coherent dream narrative that:
1. Incorporates the condensed images naturally
2. Shows displaced affects and emphasis
3. Uses concrete visual scenes
4. Includes the symbolic elements
5. Maintains dream-like illogic and scene shifts
6. Has 2-3 distinct scenes

Format as JSON with scenes and narrative:
{
  "title": "Dream title reflecting main theme",
  "scenes": [
    {
      "setting": "Where the scene takes place",
      "narrative": "What happens in dream logic",
      "key_elements": ["visual elements present"],
      "emotional_tone": "feeling of the scene",
      "transitions": "how it shifts to next scene"
    }
  ],
  "overall_narrative": "Brief summary of dream flow",
  "dream_logic_elements": ["impossible things that feel normal"]
}
