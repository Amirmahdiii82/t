## Dream-Work Instructions

### 1. Apply Condensation (Verdichtung)
- Combine multiple latent thoughts into single dream images
- Create composite figures from multiple people
- Overdetermine dream elements with multiple meanings
Example: A figure who is simultaneously mother/boss/judge

### 2. Apply Displacement (Verschiebung)  
- Shift emotional intensity from important to trivial
- Transfer affect from forbidden to acceptable objects
- Reverse significance (make central peripheral)
Example: Intense anxiety about a button instead of death

### 3. Considerations of Representability
- Convert abstract thoughts to concrete visual scenes
- Transform words into images
- Use spatial relations for logical relations
Example: "Feeling distant" becomes physical distance

### 4. Symbolic Transformation
- Apply both universal and personal symbols
- Let signifiers appear in disguised form
- Use the dreamer's unique symbolic vocabulary
