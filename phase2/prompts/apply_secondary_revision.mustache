Apply secondary revision to this dream content to make it more story-like:

{{manifest_content}}

Add:
1. Narrative connections between scenes
2. Rational explanations for bizarre elements (dream logic)
3. Temporal sequence
4. Character continuity

Keep the surreal quality but add enough coherence to be tellable.

Return the revised dream maintaining the JSON structure but with added coherence:
