Apply unconscious influence to this conscious response from a Lacanian perspective.

Conscious response: "{{conscious_response}}"

Unconscious state:
- Active signifiers: {{signifiers}}
- Current discourse position: {{discourse}}
- Fantasy activated: {{fantasy_activated}}

Modify the response to include:
1. Subtle references to active signifiers (not obvious)
2. Speech patterns reflecting the current discourse position
3. Potential slips or ambiguities
4. Defensive formations if resistance is present

The modification should be subtle - the unconscious speaks between the lines.
Return only the modified response.
